# Food Lovers - Milestone Project - Backend Development

Hello Everyone, 

I welcome you all to my lovely Milestone Project - where I show you the power of Python and Data driven development using the flask framework. This project is an online cookbook web application where fellow food enthusiast can signup, add recipes of their own, and share with the rest of the community.

## UX

### Project Goals
The purpose of the Food Lovers Web Application Project, is to build an online cook book community for people that love food and would like to share that passion with others. 

### User's Goal
The user's goals would be to find list of new inspiring recipe ideas to explore and add their own original recipes that other users may be interested in.

### Site owner's goal 
Get the users more engage in adding and sharing recipe with the rest of the world, leading to further development of the **Food Lovers** website as a community.

### User stories
- As a member of the website, I would like to be able view records of my recipes shared through my profile, so that I can easily update or delete it.
    - I should also have the capability to Add, view, edit and delete my own food categories.
- As a first time visiter of the site, It would be awesome to view a list of all recipes either by category or none.

## Deployment

The Food Lovers - Backend Development Project - has been deployed to ðŸ‘‰[Heroku.](https://python-and-datacentric-project.herokuapp.com/)ðŸ‘ˆ

### Deploying To Heroku

1. In order to deploy to heroku, a Github repository was created for the project.
2. Make sure to have downloaded [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash)
3. Go to the root folder directory of the app on the local computer.
4. Right click it and select **Git Bash here** to open the CLI terminal.
5. Initialize the project directory by typing ```git init``` in the terminal and pressing the Enter key.
6. Copy the url of the Github repository created for the app.
7. On the terminal, add the url you copied, as a remote with the command 
    ```git remote add origin <paste your github URL here> ```

8. Next, commit all your changes to git with these commands
    ```bash
    git add . 
    git commit -m "Your message here. Example <First commit>"
    ```
9. Create the main branch of your repository with the command ```git branch -M main```
10.  After the steps above,  the project can now be pushed to the repository with the command ```git push```
11. Now the project is ready to be deployed to Heroku.
12. Before deploying our Python App to Heroku, 2 files will need to be created. **Procfile and Requirements.txt**
    1. In the gitbash terminal of the root folder directory of the project. Run these commands to create the procfile and requirements.txt. Note: Make sure you have downloaded and added python to your environment variables.
    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    touch Procfile
    ```
    2. Make sure the Procfile created has a capital "P" in the title. Open the Procfile in a text editor and add this line of text on the first line ```web: python app.py```. Note: make sure there is not extra line after the first one. Not even an empty line.
    3. Repeat step 8 and 10 of the steps above.
13. After creating an account on Heroku, an app name where the project is hosted will need to be created from the dash board.

14. Select the app created.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/appname.PNG?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

15. Click on the settings tab and then click the **Reveal Config Vars** to add the config variables of the python application.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/settings.PNG?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

16. The config variables added will be similar to the ```env.py``` file utilized in deploying the application on the local PC, similar to the variables in enclosed in brackets in this [env sample](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/TaskManagerAuth/blob/main/08-SearchingWithinTheDatabase/01-text_index_searching/env_sample.py)
17. Once the config vars are added, navigate to the **Deploy** tab.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/deploytab.png?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

18. In the diployment section, select Github for the deployment method and connect to the github repository for the project by searching for its name.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/deploy.png?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

19. Further down the page you will have to select the automatic deployment and for the manual deploy section, choose main branch and click the ```Deploy Branch``` button.
<img src="https://github.com/kmadjei/MilestoneProject-Python-and-DataCentricDevelopment/blob/master/static/images/herokudeploy/viewlive.png?raw=true" alt="Deploy image">

20. The above steps will cause Heroku to process the project files and create a link for you to view the live deployment of the Flask Web Application Project.
